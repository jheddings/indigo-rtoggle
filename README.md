# indigo-rtoggle

Provides actions to help toggle devices at random intervals.

## Requirements

[Indigo Pro](https://www.indigodomo.com) is required to get support for plugins.  If you
haven't tried Indigo and are interested in home automation, please give it a shot right
away...  You won't be disappointed!

## Installation

This plugin is installed like any other Indigo plugin.  Visit the
[releases](https://github.com/jheddings/indigo-rtoggle/releases) page and download the latest
version.  For advanced users, you may also clone the source tree directly into your Indigo
plugins folder, making updates as easy as pull & reload.

## Configuration

After installing the first time, you will be prompted for the plugin configuration.  You
can also access the plugin config at any time from the Plugins menu.

## Usage

## Updates

From the plugin's menu, select "Check for Updates" to look for newer releases of the
plugin.  Any updates will be displayed in the Indigo event log.
